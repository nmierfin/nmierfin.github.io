Lastly, safety systems had to be put in place, such as lightning arresters, fuses, circuit breakers and relays to prevent faults in the larger grid. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">I have designed, simulated, built, and tested a microwave amplifier at 3.1 GHz frequency in a 50Ω system. To design the circuit, NI-AWR Microwave Office was utilized. The input and output matching networks were designed using open circuited shunt stubs since they can be easily fabricated and allow some tuning. I have calculated the maximum gain of the BJT from the given S parameters in the data sheet, ensured that the amplifier is stable over the entire useful bandwidth of the device, minimized S11 and S22, and maximized the bandwidth. The circuit was then fabricated with RT/Duroid 5880 with a dielectric thickness of 787.41µm. In the final step, I assembled and mounted the circuit on the microwave test jig and tested it with a VNA.</p>

The substrate used in the design is RT/Duroid 5880 with a dielectric thickness of 1.574mm. I have calculated, simulated, and measured the electric field in various planes of polarization and the S parameters. I maximized the input return loss at port 1 of the feed network to ensure that the power from the generator will enter the feed network and be available to the antenna patches. In addition to that I made sure that the array design was matched to 50 Ω with zero reactance, zero reflection, and full transmission.</p>
